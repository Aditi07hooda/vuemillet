      <h1 class="text-center mb-4">The Story of Millet Store</h1>
      <p class="md:px-8 py-4">
        Every story has a beginning. Ours began one fine morning with a simple and
        innocent question posed by my little daughter, "Why does chapatti have no
        taste, amma?" Taken aback but intrigued, I undertook a year-long journey
        to understand the food we eat - traditional and modern; and ways to make
        them even better.
      </p>
      <p class="md:px-8 py-4">
        After many trials and errors and much experimentation on my family, the
        perfect atta recipe was finally found. The result was a wide variety of
        flours that made the everyday rotis different and interesting. Our atta
        dough is easy to handle and makes amazing rotis that are great in taste
        and stay soft for up to 12 hours.
      </p>
      <p class="md:px-8 py-4">
        Encouraged by the overwhelming response received from friends and family,
        I decided to open 'The Millet Store' in September 2019. Since then, we
        have introduced freshly milled flours (rice, ragi, jowar, buckwheat, etc),
        wood pressed oil (coconut, groundnut and sesame) and jaggery from our own
        farm.
      </p>
      <p class="md:px-8 py-4">
        We have also developed our signature attas (Sharbati, Emmer, Fenugreek
        &amp; Poppy Seeds), Multi-Grain (8 grains), Multi-Millet (5 millets),
        Methi Masala Atta, Drumstick Leaf Masala Atta and many more.
      </p>
      <p class="md:px-8 py-4">
        The Millet Store specialises in making ready mixes and special attas,
        which are easy to use and store. The ingredients are freshly sourced and
        each product is customised to suit the taste and varying requirements of
        our customers. If you want it, we can make it!
      </p>
      <p class="md:px-8 py-4">
        We work diligently to offer you the best in taste, nutrition and
        convenience. The Millet Store maintains strict hygiene and quality
        standards to retain the freshness and nutritional content of every single
        ingredient that we use.
      </p>
      <p class="md:px-8 py-4">
        Through our products, we hope to re-introduce the wonders and benefits of
        whole grains and flours and make them equally tempting for all age groups.
        We understand the nutritional needs of children, adults and seniors; and
        the practical constraints of a busy schedule, along with the challenges it
        throws up for healthy home-cooked meals.
      </p>
      <p class="md:px-8 py-4">
        Our healthy ready mixes and flours lend a helping hand to any home cook
        who needs it - students, young working adults, fresh cooks or anyone
        looking to cook up a delicious storm in the kitchen super quick. No
        preparation, no mess, no cutting, no chopping, no cleaning and no fuss. We
        assure our customers of fast and easy products, which they can use
        anytime.
      </p>
      <p class="md:px-8 py-4">
        The moment you place an order, we get to work procuring fresh organic
        produce, milling them and packing them under stringent safety measures. We
        deliver within the time frame we promise. Since we do not add any kind of
        preservatives, our products have a limited shelf life and must be consumed
        within the specified date.
      </p>
      <p class="md:px-8 py-4">
        Our promise is simple - We strive to make food delicious for you and your
        family.
